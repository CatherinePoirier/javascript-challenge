Used the index.html file provided for this challenge. The provided dataset was used to append a table to the web page. I used the given column data of

date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment.
Using JavaScript code, I created a date Form in the HTML document that listend for events and then searches through the date/time column to find row that match the input.
